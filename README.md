**Building and testing a to-do list tracker**
The objective of this project is to develop testing functions for a to-do list, before we start building the application. We will create automated tests covering all user stories.

### Automated tests - Core ðŸ§ª

- Add tasks
- Check completed items off
- Delete items I do not need any more
- Accessibility for motor impaired users
  - use all features without a mouse
- Filter out completed to-dos

### Acceptance Criteria ðŸŽ¯

- A working to-do list
- Tests for at least each user story
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Accessible by as many users as possible
